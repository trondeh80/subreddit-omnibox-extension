### Reddit url completer
A dumb extension that uses omnibox to activate a custom url input mechanism in chrome


#### Installation
git clone this project, and add the folder in your extensions setup. Since this is such a small extension, I have no plans of adding it to play store.

#### Usage
In the address bar, you can type `r/` and space, and the input will change allowing you to type the name of the subreddit you want to navigate to.
